# 🌞 TinySolar-248m-4k Fine-tuning Project

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project aims to fine-tune the TinySolar-248m-4k model on the CodeAlpaca-20k dataset using various advanced fine-tuning techniques. The goal is to create an efficient code generation model while exploring different fine-tuning methodologies.

## 🏗️ Current Status

This project is currently in progress. We are experimenting with different fine-tuning techniques to optimize the performance of the TinySolar-248m-4k model on code generation tasks.

## 🧪 Planned Fine-tuning Techniques

We plan to implement and compare the following fine-tuning methods:

1. 🔧 LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)
2. 🔬 QLoRA (Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation)
3. 🧮 GLoRA (Grouped Low-Rank Adaptation)
4. 🔄 DoRA (Double Low-Rank Adaptation)
5. 📊 Linear Probing

Each of these techniques will be implemented and evaluated to determine the most effective approach for fine-tuning the TinySolar model on the CodeAlpaca dataset.

## 🛠️ Usage

### Fine-tuning

To run the fine-tuning process:

```bash
python finetune.py
```

Note: The fine-tuning script will be updated to incorporate the different techniques as they are implemented.

### Inference

To test the fine-tuned model, use the `inference.ipynb` notebook. This notebook will be updated to work with the latest fine-tuned model versions.

## 📈 Monitoring

We use Weights & Biases (wandb) for experiment tracking and visualization. Check the `wandb/` directory for logs and the wandb dashboard for detailed metrics and comparisons between different fine-tuning approaches.

## 🔮 Future Work

- Implement each of the planned fine-tuning techniques
- Compare and analyze the performance of each technique
- Optimize hyperparameters for the best-performing methods
- Develop a comprehensive evaluation framework for code generation tasks
